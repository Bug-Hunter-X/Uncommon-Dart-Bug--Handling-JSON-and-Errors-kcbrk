# Uncommon Dart Bug: Handling JSON and Errors

This repository demonstrates a common Dart coding error related to JSON handling and error management. The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to fetch data from an API, parse the JSON response, and then accesses a key that might not exist.  This can lead to runtime exceptions. Additionally, the error handling is minimal, only printing the error to the console without any retry attempts or detailed error reporting.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version that addresses these issues by:

1. **Checking for key existence**: Before accessing a key, the code verifies if it exists in the JSON response.
2. **Robust error handling**: The code includes more comprehensive error handling, including informative error messages and potential retry mechanisms.

This example highlights the importance of defensive programming and proper error management in Dart applications.
